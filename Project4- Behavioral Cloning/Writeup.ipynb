    "## Objective \n",
    "In this project we have clone the behavior of the driver for steering movement on the track provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Following files are included\n",
    "1. model.py : Model implementation code\n",
    "2. drive.py : Code to run on the track (I haven't made changes to it as provided by Udacity)\n",
    "3. run1.mp4 : video generated by running model to drive the car\n",
    "4. model.h5 : Trained model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to solve \n",
    "1. Data generation and collection\n",
    "2. Model Architecture\n",
    "3. Model training \n",
    "4. Model evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality of Code \n",
    "##### 1. Is the code functional? \n",
    "Video has been generated in the simulation using model.h5 generated after training by model.py\n",
    "##### 2. Is the code usable and readable? \n",
    "Code is commented and it is kept in mind to generate the data while training instead of storing it in memory using generators as it will hamper the main part of model training \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Strategy \n",
    "#### 1. Has an appropriate model architecture been employed for the task?\n",
    "I have implemented network created by Nvidia for same task, following features are included :\n",
    "1. Normalization layer for faster conversion\n",
    "2. Cropping the image to include the necessary part which decides the steering movement\n",
    "3. 5 Convolution layers with filter sizes in increasing order to reduce the dimensions and gaining as much information from the start\n",
    "4. 3 fully connected layers with \"elu\" activation instead of \"relu\". Got the reference for same from slack as it lead to faster training \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Has an attempt been made to reduce overfitting of the model?\n",
    "1. Drop out is added in dense layers as without them model was overfitting and validation accuracy was not good\n",
    "2. Data is split in training and validation with shuffling while genrating batches of 32 to keep the randomness and reduce overfitting\n",
    "3. Data has been genernated by flipping the center images\n",
    "4. I have tried to use left and right camera images but results were not good that is model was getting biased as we have to define the correction in steering for using them and tuning it was taking lot of time\n",
    "5. Trained the model for 10 epochs as accuracy was kept on increasing till 5 and we want stablility in that\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Have the model parameters been tuned appropriately?\n",
    "1. Experimented with learning rate from 0.01 to 0.00001 and best result came out at 0.00001\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Is the training data chosen appropriately?\n",
    "1. I have used training data provided by udacity. Didn't collect more data like recovery because it was not getting stored while trying to do so may be because of internet connectivity issues.:\n",
    "\n",
    "Orignal image and flipped image are present in the folder for submission\n"

    "### Architecture and Training Documentation\n",
    "#### 1. Is the solution design documented?\n",
    "I have used Nvidia's network which includes 5 convolution layers which gives complexity to identify the curvature and direction and value to move the steering\n",
    "Here is the link for same :\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Is the creation of the training dataset and training process documented?\n",
    "1. Images are stored in run1 folder from simulation\n",
    "2. Dataset has center ,right and left camera images mounted on car\n",
    "3. Training data consist of center images + flipped center images to get the idea of curvature direction\n",
    "4. Left and right camera are not used in final model as it was taking too long to do experiment for tuning the hyperparameter that needs to be added to steering for using them\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation\n",
    "Car is on track and passed the bridge , a high curvature curve as well\n",
